# Research-Project
This repository will contain codes for the research project I am conducting. The entire project will be separated into 3 different parts. 
1. Web Scraping (getting the data from the internet)
2. Data Cleansing (making sure the data is clean and ready to explored)
3. Data Visualization (making useful insights from the data)
4. Data Modelling (building a prediction model)
